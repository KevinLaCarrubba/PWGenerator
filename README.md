# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## Your Task

This week’s homework requires you to modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that they’ve selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.


## User Story

In the currerent state of the world our entire life is online. The only thing stopping another person from accessing your data is your password. Many people, myself included, tend 
to create passwords about loved ones or memories. While it is easy to remember, it is not as safe as a randomly generated passowrd. I created this password generator to get out of the bad habit of constantly reusing the same passowrd and making guesssable password if you know me well enough. 

## How it works

When the page loads you will see a generate password button. After clicking this, the user will be asked a series of questions. First, the length and then followed by which type of characters will be added to your password. If the user selects none of the options the program will alert the user at least one must be selected. After the user decides which characters they want their password to consist of the program will randomize the characters. It will then run through the arrays and add them one by one to the final array which will then be randomized one more time and turned into a string which will then display the password to be copied by the user.
